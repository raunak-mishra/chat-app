Developed a chat application using Express, Websockets. Though we can use plain websockets but we would be using a library called Socket.io - which is wrapper around Websockets, it's super easy to use and provides a fallback to xhr requests until the websocket connection is established.

The frontend-ui is based on Flexbox, no external UI libraries are used, so we can modify it as we like.
